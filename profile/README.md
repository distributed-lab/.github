Distributed Lab is a Ukrainian cryptography & engineering team focused on Bitcoin/EVM ecosystems. It has ~100 team members, most of whom are in Kyiv office, which helped to build over 250 projects since 2014.

We love open source. We develop many open source products, libraries, developer tooling, etc. and believe that it brings us closer to Financial Internet.
