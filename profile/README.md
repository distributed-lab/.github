Distributed Lab is a Ukrainian cryptography and engineering team focused on cryptography-related projects (primarily in Bitcoin and EVM ecosystems). We have been operating since 2014. Our strength is the intersection of tech expertise â€” 90% of our team are engineers who work together in the Kyiv office.

We love open source. We develop many open-source products, libraries, developer tooling, etc. and believe that it brings us closer to the Financial Internet.
